<h1>Caretaker Robot</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
With the rising COVID cases in 2021, the risk of a patient contracting the virus due to the cataker-caregiver relationship increased exponentially. This was especially an issue regarding caretakers that would have to travel from a hospital, where there were a lot of COVID patients, to an older person's house. My team analyzed the situation at hand and we concluded that a lot of the medical visits were to take vitals and ensure the patient was taking the correct medication.
